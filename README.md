# About

My name is `Emily Grace Seville`. I am a native russian speaker, open source contributor and I am keen on administrating, scripting, creating sites and presentations. Itâ€™s my life. I like to automate routine tasks and not to do them manually. Currently I have the following skills (just used tools are mentioned):

```lisp
(administrating-and-scripting :used 'every-day
  :languages ("Bash" "Zsh" "Python" "Emacs Lisp" "Jq" "Sed" "Awk")
  :editors ("Emacs" "Sublime Text")
  :vcs-tools ("Git" "GitHub"))
(everything-else :used 'rarely
  :languages ("C#" "PascalABC.NET")
  :site-generators ("Hugo")
  :editors ("Krita" "Google Slides"))
```
