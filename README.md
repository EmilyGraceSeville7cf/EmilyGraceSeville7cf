## 📖 About me

I am open source contributor and I am keen on administrating, scripting,
creating sites and presentations. It’s my life. I like to automate routine tasks
and not to do them manually. Currently I have the skills mentioned below (just
the most interesting tools are mentioned and some of their usages are explained).

### :computer: Programming, markup and configuration languages

#### :hammer_and_wrench: Developing **CLI**, **TUI** and **GUI** applications

These languages are used to build applications or libraries which **should not**
be run inside some editor like GIMP or Google Slides. I'm mainly focused on
these programming languages and know them better than others, my knowledge is
validated by other contributors.

| Language | Links                                                                                                                                                              | How often do I use it? |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |

#### :hammer_and_wrench: Developing macros and libraries

These languages are used to build scripts or libraries which **should**
be run inside some editor like GIMP or Google Slides. As I utilize these
languages quite rarely I may not know them so well as previous ones and thus
don't contribute to any projects where these languages are the primary ones.

| Language     | Links                                                                                          | How often do I use it? |

#### :hammer_and_wrench: Configuration languages for applications

These languages are used to build configurations for applications or libraries.
I mainly use them for `Go` and other languages in the same category.

| Language | Links                                                                        | How often do I use it? |

| `JSON`   | [`📦`](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/pulls/EmilyGraceSeville7cf) | 4/5                    |

#### :hammer_and_wrench: Documenting developed tools

These languages are used to document everything mentioned above.

| Language   | Links             | How often do I use it? |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| `Markdown` | ❌ *not available* | 5/5                    |

## :notebook: Placeholder syntax in my CLI tools

Starting from 21 August 2024 I use the following placeholder syntax in all my
tools ([Go-inspired](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)):

- `{{placeholder}}`: some arbitrary text with no constraints implied which
  should be exactly one CLI argument.
- `{{placeholder ...}}`: almost the same thing as the previous one, but here
  zero or more arguments are expected.
- `|` can be used inside double curly braces to provide more than one
  alternative for what can be placed instead of placeholder.

, where instead of `placeholder` any text can be written which explains what
should be put instead of CLI argument(s), but without spaces unless it's
explicitly permitted. This syntax is used just when no other default syntax is
mandated.

Examples:

```fish
command {{number}} # 1 number expected
command {{number..}} # 0 or more numbers expected
command {{number|strings...}} # one number or 0 or more string expected
```
