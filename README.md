# About ðŸ’•

I am a native russian speaker, open source contributor and I am
keen on administrating, scripting, creating sites and presentations. Itâ€™s my life.
I like to automate routine tasks and not to do them manually. Currently I have the following skills
(just the most interesting tools are mentioned):

- :computer: **languages**: `Bash (CI/CD and tool prototypes)`, `ELisp (Emacs packages)`, `TinyScheme (GIMP extensions)`, `JavaScript (Visual Studio Code extensions)`
- :memo: **ides and editors**: `Micro`, `Visual Studio Code`
- :clock130: **vcs-tools**: `Git`, `GitHub`

I support several projects and organizations such as (just the most interesting ones are mentioned):

But now I mainly focused on [**[C]ommand [L]ine [I]nterface [P]ages**](https://github.com/command-line-interface-pages/prototypes/tree/main/clip-view) project:

which aims to replace [**TlDr**](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) project.

## How do I review pull requests? ðŸ‘“

For the first 2 pages less than or equal 50 lines I provide detailed mistake expanations for all issues
with links to contributing guides how to fix them.

Other remaining pages are not scanned for problems.
