## 📖 About me

I am open source contributor and I am keen on administrating, scripting,
creating sites and presentations. It’s my life. I like to automate routine tasks
and not to do them manually. Currently I have the skills mentioned below (just
the most interesting tools are mentioned and some of their usages are explained).

### :computer: Programming, markup and configuration languages

All code is mainly written in `Visual Studio Code` ([`💬`][vscode_community]),
versioned by `Git` VCS and located here.

#### :hammer_and_wrench: Developing **CLI**, **TUI** and **GUI** applications

These languages are used to build standalone applications or libraries which
**should not** be run inside some editor like GIMP or Google Slides. I'm mainly
focused on these programming languages and know them better than others, my
knowledge is validated by other contributors.

<div align="center">

</div>

#### :hammer_and_wrench: Developing macros and libraries

These languages are utilized to build scripts or libraries which **must**
be run inside some editor like GIMP or Google Slides. As I use these
languages quite rarely I may not know them so well as previous ones and thus
don't contribute to any projects where these languages are the primary ones.

</div>

#### :hammer_and_wrench: Configuration languages for applications

These languages are used to make configurations for applications or libraries.
I mainly use them for `Go` and other languages in the same category.

<div align="center">

| Language | Links                                                                        | How often do I use it? |

#### :hammer_and_wrench: Documenting developed tools

These languages are used to document everything mentioned above.

<div align="center">

| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| `Markdown` | ❌ *not available* | 5/5                    |

### :memo: Other editors

#### :hammer_and_wrench: Vector image drawing and animating them

First two tools I utilize on my laptop, the last one is used solely on mobile
devices as simple but all-in-one program for drawing and animation.

<div align="center">

</div>

#### :hammer_and_wrench: Creating presentations

Primarily I accomplish my tasks with first two tools depending on their
complexity. The last one is used on my own machine dedicated mainly
for programming when the access to my girlfriend's laptop is not possible.

<div align="center">

#### :hammer_and_wrench: Creating videos

I make videos quite rarely, but when I do I utilize this programs, the first
one on my laptop and the second one on my mobile devices.

## :notebook: Placeholder syntax in my CLI tools

Starting from 21 August 2024 I use the following placeholder syntax in all my
tools ([Go-inspired](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)):

- `{{placeholder}}`: some arbitrary text with no constraints implied which
  should be exactly one CLI argument.
- `{{placeholder ...}}`: almost the same thing as the previous one, but here
  zero or more arguments are expected.
- `|` can be used inside double curly braces to provide more than one
  alternative for what can be placed instead of placeholder.

, where instead of `placeholder` any text can be written which explains what
should be put instead of CLI argument(s), but without spaces unless it's
explicitly permitted. This syntax is used just when no other default syntax is
mandated.

Examples:

```fish
command {{number}} # 1 number expected
command {{number..}} # 0 or more numbers expected
command {{number|strings...}} # one number or 0 or more string expected
```
