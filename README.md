## Skills

My name is Emily Grace Seville. I am a native russian speaker, open source contributor and I am keen on administrating, scripting, creating sites and presentations. Itâ€™s my life. I like to automate routine tasks and not to do them manually. Currently I have the following skills (just used tools are mentioned):

- Administrating and scripting:
  - Languages: Bash, Zsh, Python, Emacs Lisp, Jq, Sed, Awk
  - Editors: Emacs, Sublime Text
  - VCS tools: Git, GitHub
- Everything else:
  - Editors: Krita, Google Slides
