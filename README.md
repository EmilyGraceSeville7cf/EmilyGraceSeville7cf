# About

I am a native russian speaker, open source contributor and I am
keen on administrating, scripting, creating sites and presentations. Itâ€™s my life.
I like to automate routine tasks and not to do them manually. Currently I have the following skills
(just the most interesting tools are mentioned):

- :computer: **languages**: _`YQ`_, _`AWK`_, `Bash`, `Emacs Lisp`, `JavaScript`, `Python`
- :memo: **ides and editors**: `Visual Studio Code`
- :clock130: **vcs-tools**: `Git`, `GitHub`

Now I am replacing `YQ` and `AWK` with my personal Python utilities as I don't to waste my energy learning too much languages.

I support several projects such as (just the most interesting ones are mentioned):

The following rules are being followed while contributing to my favorite projects:

- I review at most 5 the most recent PRs per project I contribute to everyday.
- I sent at most 2 PRs per project I contribute to everyday.

## How do I review pull requests?

In TlDr my review process is splited in 3 steps:

- Provide detailed mistake descriptions in the first TlDr page and expect a PR author to change other pages by analogue.
  Any questions are resolved here with clear explanations.
- If the PR author fails to apply mandatory fixes in other pages then I show how to do it in the second TlDr page.
  But in this step just suggestions are given.
- If the PR author fails to fix found mistakes even after the previous step then I just give a link to our style guide via this comment:
  `Please read our [style guide](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/contributing-guides/style-guide.md) and fix all remaining mandatory to fix errors. Everything unmentioned in our guide is up to you.`

In Schema store review process is simpler: it's almost the same as above but the second step is ommited (as JSON schemas are usually much larger than
  TlDr pages).
